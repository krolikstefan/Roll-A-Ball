This Roll-a-Ball project began like a typical Roll-a-Ball game - a ball rolling and collecting points using Unity’s 3D physics system. However, as the project progressed, I gradually started adding more complex mechanics.
**Highlights from this project:**

Level 2
The second level of this game is a classic Roll-a-Ball project with a small twist. I added a teleportation mechanic: when the player rolls over a specific tile, they are instantly teleported to another designated tile on the level. 
But the highlight of this level is definitely its level design and visual aspects - especially the lighting and use of color, creating one of a kind atmosphere.

Level 3
The third level of this game leans more into the RPG genre. In this stage, the player can pick up items that are added to their inventory. But that’s not all — items can also be given to an NPC, and depending on the character’s likes and dislikes, this can influence the player's relationship with them.
This mechanic is built using Unity's colliders and trigger events. All items are implemented as ScriptableObjects, which makes them easy to manage, customize, and reuse throughout the game.
